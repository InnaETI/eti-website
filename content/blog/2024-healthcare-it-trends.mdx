In engagements with healthcare companies during 2024 budgeting, a clear shift emerged: a re-evaluation of where IT investment should go. Traditional IT strategies are falling short. Success now depends on realigning budgets toward cloud-driven solutions, integrated systems, and digital patient engagement.

Here are five outdated IT trends that deserve to be retired—and where organizations are redirecting effort.

## 1. Ongoing Legacy System Enhancements

Legacy systems, once the backbone of healthcare IT, are now often impediments to innovation. Rigidity and compatibility issues with newer technologies create operational inefficiencies. In 2024, the move is toward cloud-based, modular systems that improve interoperability and scalability and let organizations adapt to changing technology and client needs.

## 2. Spreadsheet and Paper-Based Processes

Manual spreadsheets and paper-based processes are time-consuming and error-prone. The shift is toward digital workflow and data management tools that support accuracy and analytics—often with AI and machine learning—improving data integrity and decision-making.

## 3. Stand-Alone Electronic Health Record (EHR) Systems

Stand-alone EHRs contribute to data silos and limit information exchange. Integrated EHR systems with bidirectional data flow are becoming the standard, enabling a more complete view of patient health and coordinated care.

## 4. On-Premises Data Centers

On-prem data centers demand significant capital, maintenance, and staffing. Cloud storage and IaaS offer scalability, security, and cost-effectiveness while reducing overhead and increasing agility.

## 5. Traditional Patient Engagement Methods

In-person-only engagement limits reach and effectiveness. Telehealth, mobile health apps, and online patient portals are essential for convenience, personalized care, and broader access.

The healthcare IT sector is at a juncture where change is necessary for sustained success. Reallocating budgets toward these evolving strategies can boost operational efficiency and patient care while keeping organizations at the forefront of a rapidly changing landscape.
