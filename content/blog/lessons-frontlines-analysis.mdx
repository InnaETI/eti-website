ETI worked with a startup facing significant challenges with a legacy system: limited ability to support and enhance it as business needs changed. The legacy CRM-based system had been built for simpler processes; as the company and client base grew, roughly 80% of operations fell outside typical case processing. The client heavily customized the system while contending with the departure of key IT staff who held critical business knowledge. The IT budget was tied to supporting the legacy system and no longer matched the company’s growth or the reality of fragmented information. ETI was brought in to evaluate the existing system against current and future needs and to recommend a path forward.

## Analysis Techniques We Used

**Identify core business needs** — We defined core requirements and team competencies and evaluated how current assets matched key business objectives and future needs. We used techniques such as mind-mapping business processes and exceptions and comparing them to how the IT team had implemented the system, and we clarified how management made decisions and how the client used data for strategic and operational purposes.

**Skill gap analysis** — We audited IT and business personnel to see whether the existing team had the skills to execute or manage the required changes. Through interviews, review of work, and surveys we built a clear picture of current capabilities and desired skills.

**Essential customization assessment** — We distinguished what was common to the industry from what was unique to the client. We mapped need versus nice-to-have and common versus unique features to see whether the client needed something available in the market or required custom development.

**Budget allocation modeling** — We produced detailed estimates for each option, broke the system into features, and provided a model based on time to delivery, staffing, costs, and priority deliverables so leadership could see what was realistic for a given budget.

**Vendor research and market analysis** — We evaluated options using our expertise, past vendor experience, and structured vendor meetings and scorecards. We assessed internal talent and how it could be upgraded or supplemented and compared anticipated cost, time to go-live, and support.

**Legal and compliance checks** — We ensured that legality, compliance, risk, data security, and maintainability were part of the decision criteria, not afterthoughts.

**Comprehensive TCO** — We helped the client understand all anticipated costs and potential savings for each option, including costs within the company’s control and those that could vary year to year.

This structured analysis gave the client a clear set of options and the confidence to choose a direction. If you’re facing a Fix vs. Build vs. Buy decision, a 360-degree analysis is the foundation for a successful outcome.
