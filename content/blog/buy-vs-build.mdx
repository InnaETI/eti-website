In the strategic landscape of Buy vs. Build, treat each decision as a calculated move. Each option should align with your organization’s objectives, size, and operational context. Based on our experience helping companies through this process, here’s what to strengthen, what to rethink, and what to adopt.

## Continue: Strengthening Your Foundations

**Vendor research and market analysis** — Scrutinize suppliers and market dynamics to see whether an off-the-shelf solution can suffice and conserve resources.

**Initial budget allocation** — Set a clear budget framework for the project from the start.

**Stakeholder involvement** — Include key stakeholders from multiple departments early so multiple viewpoints shape the outcome.

**Identifying core business needs** — Pinpoint essential requirements before exploring solutions so the solution you choose aligns with strategic objectives.

**Time-to-market estimates** — Use this as a key metric so choices align with market opportunities.

**Legal and compliance checks** — Ensure the chosen solution adheres to relevant laws and industry standards.

**Post-implementation support** — Factor in the full life cycle of the solution beyond initial rollout.

## Stop: Rethinking Common Pitfalls

**Ignoring standardization** — Over-customizing can lead to unwieldy solutions. Balance customization with standardization.

**Overlooking outsourcing** — In-house isn’t always better. Consider outsourcing as a viable option.

**Skimping on risk assessments** — Rigorous risk assessment is non-negotiable.

**Assuming vendor size equals quality** — Larger vendors may not offer the agility or focus that a smaller provider could.

**Tunnel vision on costs** — Look at long-term expenses and ROI, not only upfront cost.

**Isolated decision-making** — Include HR, Marketing, and Operations—not only IT or Finance—for a 360-degree view.

**Overlooking scalability** — Choose a platform that can adapt and scale with your evolving business.

## Start: Raising the Bar

**Comprehensive TCO** — Include ongoing costs like maintenance, updates, and exit costs.

**Rollout strategy** — Decide in advance between “big bang” and phased implementation.

**Skill gap analysis** — Audit internal capabilities to execute or manage the solution.

**Vendor scorecards** — Score vendors on reliability, cost, support, and cybersecurity.

**Understand out-of-box features** — Assess how closely the platform aligns with your needs without modification and use it as a baseline for comparison.

**Essential customization assessment** — Separate must-haves from nice-to-haves early.

**Pilot testing** — Run a smaller pilot before full rollout to surface issues and gather stakeholder feedback.

Integrating these practices positions your organization for sharper, more calculated Buy vs. Build decisions.

## Lessons from the Frontlines: 360-Degree Analysis

ETI worked with a startup facing significant challenges with a legacy system: limited ability to support and enhance it as business needs changed. The legacy CRM-based system had been built for simpler processes; as the company and client base grew, roughly 80% of operations fell outside typical case processing. The client heavily customized the system while contending with the departure of key IT staff who held critical business knowledge. The IT budget was tied to supporting the legacy system and no longer matched the company’s growth or the reality of fragmented information. ETI was brought in to evaluate the existing system against current and future needs and to recommend a path forward.

### Analysis Techniques We Used

**Identify core business needs** — We defined core requirements and team competencies and evaluated how current assets matched key business objectives and future needs. We used techniques such as mind-mapping business processes and exceptions and comparing them to how the IT team had implemented the system, and we clarified how management made decisions and how the client used data for strategic and operational purposes.

**Skill gap analysis** — We audited IT and business personnel to see whether the existing team had the skills to execute or manage the required changes. Through interviews, review of work, and surveys we built a clear picture of current capabilities and desired skills.

**Essential customization assessment** — We distinguished what was common to the industry from what was unique to the client. We mapped need versus nice-to-have and common versus unique features to see whether the client needed something available in the market or required custom development.

**Budget allocation modeling** — We produced detailed estimates for each option, broke the system into features, and provided a model based on time to delivery, staffing, costs, and priority deliverables so leadership could see what was realistic for a given budget.

**Vendor research and market analysis** — We evaluated options using our expertise, past vendor experience, and structured vendor meetings and scorecards. We assessed internal talent and how it could be upgraded or supplemented and compared anticipated cost, time to go-live, and support.

**Legal and compliance checks** — We ensured that legality, compliance, risk, data security, and maintainability were part of the decision criteria, not afterthoughts.

**Comprehensive TCO** — We helped the client understand all anticipated costs and potential savings for each option, including costs within the company’s control and those that could vary year to year.

This structured analysis gave the client a clear set of options and the confidence to choose a direction. If you’re facing a Fix vs. Build vs. Buy decision, a 360-degree analysis is the foundation for a successful outcome.
