In the strategic landscape of Buy vs. Build, treat each decision as a calculated move. Each option should align with your organization’s objectives, size, and operational context. Based on our experience helping companies through this process, here’s what to strengthen, what to rethink, and what to adopt.

## Continue: Strengthening Your Foundations

**Vendor research and market analysis** — Scrutinize suppliers and market dynamics to see whether an off-the-shelf solution can suffice and conserve resources.

**Initial budget allocation** — Set a clear budget framework for the project from the start.

**Stakeholder involvement** — Include key stakeholders from multiple departments early so multiple viewpoints shape the outcome.

**Identifying core business needs** — Pinpoint essential requirements before exploring solutions so the solution you choose aligns with strategic objectives.

**Time-to-market estimates** — Use this as a key metric so choices align with market opportunities.

**Legal and compliance checks** — Ensure the chosen solution adheres to relevant laws and industry standards.

**Post-implementation support** — Factor in the full life cycle of the solution beyond initial rollout.

## Stop: Rethinking Common Pitfalls

**Ignoring standardization** — Over-customizing can lead to unwieldy solutions. Balance customization with standardization.

**Overlooking outsourcing** — In-house isn’t always better. Consider outsourcing as a viable option.

**Skimping on risk assessments** — Rigorous risk assessment is non-negotiable.

**Assuming vendor size equals quality** — Larger vendors may not offer the agility or focus that a smaller provider could.

**Tunnel vision on costs** — Look at long-term expenses and ROI, not only upfront cost.

**Isolated decision-making** — Include HR, Marketing, and Operations—not only IT or Finance—for a 360-degree view.

**Overlooking scalability** — Choose a platform that can adapt and scale with your evolving business.

## Start: Raising the Bar

**Comprehensive TCO** — Include ongoing costs like maintenance, updates, and exit costs.

**Rollout strategy** — Decide in advance between “big bang” and phased implementation.

**Skill gap analysis** — Audit internal capabilities to execute or manage the solution.

**Vendor scorecards** — Score vendors on reliability, cost, support, and cybersecurity.

**Understand out-of-box features** — Assess how closely the platform aligns with your needs without modification and use it as a baseline for comparison.

**Essential customization assessment** — Separate must-haves from nice-to-haves early.

**Pilot testing** — Run a smaller pilot before full rollout to surface issues and gather stakeholder feedback.

Integrating these practices positions your organization for sharper, more calculated Buy vs. Build decisions.
